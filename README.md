# OOP-NationNarrowBank

Project created for second Java assessment at university. This project was designed to make the students practice everything learnt from OOP and also how to create java interfaces without the help of swing.
The project simulates a simple bank system where it is possible to create accounts, do daily bank related operations and also print a report if logged in as manager.
